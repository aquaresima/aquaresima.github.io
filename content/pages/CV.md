## Research and Teaching Experience

_Max Planck Insititute for Psycholinguistics, Radboud University, Nijmegen_ <br>
__Ph.D. in Neurobiology of Language__ <br>
_2019 - 2024_ <br>
My research examined a biophysical model of word recognition during speech. I investigated the role of cellular level processes in learning and recalling word memories. The work combines insights from computational neuroscience with experimental evidence in word recognition. The result of my study is a mechanistic hypothesis concerning the link between human neurobiology and the human capacity to process complex sequences of sounds.
