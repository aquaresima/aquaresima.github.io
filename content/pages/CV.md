## Research and Teaching Experience

_Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen_<br>
__PostDoc position at NBL Department__ <br>
After the conclusion of my Ph.D. dissertation, I continued working on the spiking neural network
simulator developed for the project. The goal is to have a flexible tool
for neurobiologically detailed simulations.

_Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen_<br>
__Ph.D. Candidate__<br>
 I achieved my Ph.D. degree in Psychology of Language. Part of the work involved developing a Julia library for integrating and analyzing simulations of spiking neural networks with dendrites. I also gained experience in presenting my work to large audiences.

_Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen_ <br>
__Thesis supervision__ <br> 
During my Ph.D. I co-supervised several bachelor theses on the encoding of acoustic information in spiking neural networks.

_The Science Zone -- Elementary schools, Rome_ <br>
__Teacher in elementary schools__ <br>
 I was an active member of a science
outreach association that used the Inquiry-Based Scientific Education
method to teach young students Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
