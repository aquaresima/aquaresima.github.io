Title: About me
page_order: 9


I was born in Rome and spent my youth a medieval village in the beautiful _campagna romana_. After high school, I moved
to Rome to follow the curriculum at the Physics faculty in Sapienza University. In those years I learned about mechanics while repairing bikes at local Ciclo Officina di Fisica. I attended courses with G. Parisi, P. del Giudice, and V. Loreto, who fostered my scientific interests in complexity, statistics, and neuroscience. 
Meanwhile, he participated in The Science Zone, a science education association fostering experimental science in school, and in AvANa / Le Dita Nella Presa, a hacklab striving for digital freedom, technological justice and awareness.

My first academic achievement was a BSc thesis in Complexity Theory with V. Servedio, analyzing the information entropy of literary text. After completing the master’s courses in theoretical physics I became interested in neuroscience and pursued a thesis abroad at Diderot University, Paris, with S. Bottani and P. Monceau. There I studied models of neurites' spatial growth. 
The common interest in human language and neuroscience steered me towards a Ph.D. in the Neurobiology of Language Department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in Nijmegen.

Presently, I am running a postdoc at the Institut de l’Audition, Paris, where I investigate auditory working memory and sound perception. My interest lies in the physiological understanding of how the human brain supports language. Alessio is also invested in science communication. In Nijmegen, he kept himself busy organizing public events on the verge of arts and science. Among the others, he co-organized the opening of the BioMa lab and talked about simulation in neuroscience at the In Science Nijmegen Film Festival. He also wrote several pieces for the MPI Talkling and Het Talige Brein outreach blogs. In his free time, he enjoys walking uphill in the Alps, swimming in lakes, attending expositions, and more recently he became keen on video projections and live performances.
