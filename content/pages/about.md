Title: About me
page_order: 10

I was born in Rome and grew up in a charming medieval village nestled in the beautiful campagna romana. After finishing high school, I moved to Rome to study Physics at Sapienza University. During those years, I dived into mechanics while fixing bikes at the local Ciclo Officina di Fisica. I had the privilege of attending courses with renowned professors like G. Parisi, P. del Giudice, and V. Loreto, who sparked my interest in complexity, statistics, and neuroscience.

Alongside my studies, I was actively involved in The Science Zone, an association dedicated to promoting experimental science in schools. I also participated in AvANa / Le Dita Nella Presa, a hacklab advocating for digital freedom, technological justice, and awareness.

My first academic achievement was my BSc thesis in Complexity Theory with V. Servedio and V. Loreto, where I analyzed the information entropy of literary texts using compression algorithms. After completing my master’s courses in theoretical physics, I became fascinated with neuroscience and decided to pursue a thesis abroad at Diderot University in Paris, under the co-supervision of Dr. S. Bottani and Prof. Dr. P. Del Giudice on models of neurites' spatial growth. For the master-thesis project I co-developed a neuronal growth simulator with Dr. T. Fardet. 

The intersection of my interests in human language and neuroscience led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the Neurobiology of Language Department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. There I advanced a mechanistic hypothesis on the cellular and network dynamics underlaying spoken word recognition. I worked under the guidance of Dr. KM Petersson, Dr. H Fitz, and Prof. Dr. P. Hagoort.

Currently, I'm doing a postdoc at the Institut de l’Audition in Paris, where I'm investigating auditory working memory and sound perception. My passion lies in understanding the physiological mechanisms that support language in the human brain. I'm also deeply invested in science communication. 

During my time in Nijmegen, I organized various public events that blended arts and science. I co-organized the opening of the BioMa lab and spoke about simulation in neuroscience at the InScience Nijmegen Film Festival. I've also written several pieces for the MPI Talking and Het Talige Brein outreach blogs.
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, swimming in lakes, visiting exhibitions, and recently, I've developed a keen interest in video projections and live performances.
