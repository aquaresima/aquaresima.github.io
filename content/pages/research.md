I am -losely- active on the following topics and I am interested in supervising students or pursuing collaborations

### Dendritic memory in the formation of hetero-associative connections
I recently issued a research paper where I investigate the capacity of dendritic network to detect sequences ([Dendrites support formation and reactivation of sequential memories through Hebbian plasticity 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.26.559322v2.full.pdf+html)). One outcome of the computational study is the formation of hetero-associative connections between the low-level (phonemes) and high-level (word) assemblies. The study did not clarify, however, which are is the range of the plasticity rule in which this connections can form. Even more, it remains unclear how the dendritic processes contribute to the formation of synaptic connections whose weight depends on the serial order of the phoneme in the word. 

### Context-dependent integration of feedforward stimuli in spiking and rate networks

### Development of a performant Spiking Neural Network simulator in Julia

### Efficient encoding of acoustic stimuli in spiking neural networks

### Representations emerging in speech-recognition neural network models
