My research focuses on unraveling the physiological basis of the cognitive functions supporting human language. My work aims to elucidate how speech is processed in the human brain. My goal is to offer mechanistic insights into neuronal computation leveraging detailed biophysical models. 

### Neuronal and network mechanisms of Auditory Working Memory
Computational and experimental studies indicate that auditory working memory lies in the physiological properties of single-cells and the connectivity of cortical networks. However, how these mechanisms for memory interact during the encoding, maintaining, and retrieving of cued memories remains largely unknown. 
The project aims to establish the role of cellular- and network-level processes in maintaining short-term memories. The investigation is carried out studying a biophysical network model and comparing it with [calcium imaging recordings at single-cell resolution](10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.043). 


### Dendritic memory and hetero-associative memories
I recently issued a research paper on the capacity of biological networks to detect sequences of brief, transitory stimuli ([Dendrites support formation and reactivation of sequential memories through Hebbian plasticity 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.26.559322v2.full.pdf+html)). 
The computational study demonstrates the formation of hetero-associative memories, in the form of asymmetric synaptic engrams, between low-level (phonemes) and high-level (word) cell assemblies. The synaptic structure is necessary and sufficient for the word assemblies to activate upon the presentation of the correct sequence of phonemes.

### Self-organizations in networks with dendrites 
The previous study did not clarify the plasticity mechanisms that foster the formation of hetero-associative memories. Even more, it remains unclear how the dendrites contribute to it. 
I am interested in testing recent biologically-plausible plasticity rules to evaluate which are the computational requirements for the formation of sequence-detection networks.
