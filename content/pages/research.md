I am -losely- active on the following topics and I am interested in supervising students or pursuing collaborations. 

I believe that computational research is well suited for researcher with limited access to experimental facilities. Thus, I am willing to tutor students from countries where it is harder to carry traditional research, please contact me if your are interested in a collaboration.

### Dendritic memory in the formation of hetero-associative connections
I recently issued a research paper where I investigate the capacity of dendritic network to detect sequences ([Dendrites support formation and reactivation of sequential memories through Hebbian plasticity 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.26.559322v2.full.pdf+html)). One outcome of the computational study is the formation of hetero-associative connections between the low-level (phonemes) and high-level (word) assemblies. The study did not clarify, however, which are is the range of the plasticity rule in which this connections can form. Even more, it remains unclear how the dendritic processes contribute to the formation of synaptic connections whose weight depends on the serial order of the phoneme in the word. 

### STDP-driven self-organizations in networks with dendrites 
<!-- The dendritic network investigated tends to self-organize in   -->
<!-- % Seminal work investigated the spontaneous activity of networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurons~\citep{vreeswijkChaoticBalancedState1998,brunelDynamicsSparselyConnected2000} revealing the presence of a regime of low firing rate and low synchrony when the connections are sufficiently diluted.  -->



### Context-dependent integration of feedforward stimuli in spiking and rate networks

### Development of a performant Spiking Neural Network simulator in Julia

### Efficient encoding of acoustic stimuli in spiking neural networks

### Representations emerging in speech-recognition neural network models
