_Science must be accessible to everyone, and it's fun_


I write and talk about science and its social implications in several settings, be them official blogs, radio shows or fanzine outlets. My topics of interest are ecology, neuroscience, technology, and astronomy.

I have solid experience in organizing and presenting at scientific events to the general public. I have also experience as editor and writer for science outreach outlets.

## Women Scientists for Environmental Justice

In 2020-2021, The Science Zone association was running a project to teach climate-awareness at school. Because of the COVID-19 lockdowns, most of classes could not take place and we could talk with our students only through the screens. 

We thought to use this constraint in a creative way and decided to reach out towards scientists operating in various regions of the planet in support of local, indigenous communities. The result was a collection of interviews on topics related to climate-justice; such as the impact of extractivism for local communities, the relationship between western and traditional knowledge, and why indigenous living styles have low impact on local ecosystems.

You can find the collection of interviews [here](https://www.inventati.org/debris/ws4ej/index.html).
